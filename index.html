				  	<h2>Parkour</h2>
				  	<p>I have different hobbies, but the first one is the parkour. I'm doing Parkour for 5 years in club with friend. I discover Parkour when I was 10, thanks to video in internet. And I started alone but just for leisure. Then a club have open and I try hard this sport. It consists of go to aa place A to a place B the fastest possible, but there is also the freestyle where the goal is to do tricks in the street.

				  	<h2>Tennis</h2>
				  	<p>I really like tennis, I played 10 years tennis, I started at the age of 6. I was at first for leisure. I was happy to do tennis with my friend and then we decided to do some competition. And that’s the turn over, I broke my arms and my team has lost every match. Moreover I was doing a regional competition but I had to stop because of my arm and I decided to stop. Not only because I was injured, but also because after 10 years I have done every things in this sport.

				  	<h2>Snowboard</h2>
				  	<p>My favourite sport during the winter, is the snowboard. That’s a special feeling that you can feel only in snowboard. The speed and the many possibilities of tricks is I think the best thing. The possibilities of evolution are huge.

				  	<h2>Surf</h2>
				  	<p>To finish one of my favourite sport that I’m doing during all the year, is the surf. Usually with one friend because sometimes there is no wave so during this time you can talk. But, the surf allowed lot of skills to be good and enjoyed the wave. Thats what I like in this sport, the challenge with your friend to be the best and the difficulty to improve in this sport.
